## üìä Dataset Structure
The dataset is formatted as a JSON array, with each element representing a distinct multiple-choice question (MCQ). The structure of each question object is outlined below:

#### Key - Description - Type
- `id` - Unique identifier for the question - Integer
- `question` - The question text - String
- `options` - An array of answer options - Array of objects

#### Example JSON Object
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "question": "What type of form must a claimant complete to initiate legal action in a civil court?",
  "options": [
    {"option": "Civil action", "is_correct": false},
    {"option": "Track form", "is_correct": false},
    {"option": "Claim form", "is_correct": true},
    {"option": "Business form", "is_correct": false}
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ Usage

This dataset can be employed for various purposes, including:

-   **MCQA Accuracy Assessment**: Evaluate the precision of multiple-choice question answering systems in the legal domain.
-   **Machine Learning Training**: Use this dataset to train AI models focused on assessing legal knowledge.

## üìú License
